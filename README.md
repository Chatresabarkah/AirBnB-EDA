# EDA Practice  - Exploring AirBnB Data for Broke Couples
### Background Story and Premise:
Throughout my time studying in Amsterdam, I met and saw a lot of tourists. More than I could bargain for. This was because I lived near a very tourist-dense area where there were loads of international visitors and barely any Dutch people. (If you're asking how I managed to find an apartment to rent in this area, let's just say I got unbelievably lucky)

A category of tourists that I normally bumped into, besides families and drunken British boys in their mid 30's, were young couples. Usually hailing from other European countries, they wanted to temporarily escape their home, flying away to the most romantic honeymoon - and where else to spend this endeavour, if not for the one and only, premium adult playground that is Amsterdam?

There is a problem for these young couples, however. Amsterdam is a relatively expensive city. And when you're young, you're probably not going to be in the right spectrum when it comes to financial wellness - constantly asking about what this costs compared to that (well, unless you have rich parents or bought bitcoin back in 2012) - you're most likely going to be *broke*.

### EDA Aim:

* This EDA will attempt to conduct an exploratory data analysis for this target market. We will try and flesh out the best options for a couple short on cash looking to rent an Airbnb in the city of Amsterdam. 
* Also, at the current time of writing this EDA, my status single.... however, should I in the future get a girlfriend.. I'll probably look on here for references.....
* *Cries in the background*
